0.1 (2004-03-19) : Initial Release
I read somewhepoint data. in a manner similar to mgstat_krig2d. 'release early and release often'. So. I will honor the first part of the statement by releasing mGstat very early.

Currently mGstat contains the framework to read and write gstat parameter files, and m-files to read and write data suitable for gstat.
Also, it contains mgstat_krig2d that should make it easy to perform 2d kriging from within Matlab.

To use mGstat :
* Download gstat and put it somewhere in your path (or manually edit mgstat_binary.m to point to the executable).
* Add a path to mGstat and the examples directory from withing Matlab. If you unpack mGstat to /home/tmh/mGstat do :
>> addpath /home/tmh/mGstat
>> addpath /home/tmh/mGstat/examples
and you are ready to run

http://www.gfy.ku.dk/~tmh/mgstat/ will contain some examples of what you can do.
Email questions to tmh@gfy.ku.dk
