% RANDOMSAMPLE - selects n random items from an array
%
% Usage:  items = randomsample(a, n)
%
% Arguments:    a - Either an array of values from which the items are to
%                   be selected, or an integer in which case the items
%                   are values selected from the array [1:a]
%               n - The number of items to be selected.
%
%
% This function can be used as a basic replacement for RANDSAMPLE for those
% who do not have the statistics toolbox.
% Also,
%    r = randomsample(n,n) will give a random permutation of the integers 1:n 
%
% See also: RANSAC

% Strategy is to generate a random integer index into the array and select that
% item from the array.  The selected element in the array is then overwritten by
% the last element in the array and the process is then repeated except that
% when we select the next element we generate a random integer index that lies
% in the range 1 to arraylength - 1, and so on.  This ensures items are not
% repeated.
