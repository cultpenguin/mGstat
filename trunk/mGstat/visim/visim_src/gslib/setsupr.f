c           Establish Super Block Search Limits and Sort Data
c           *************************************************
c
c This subroutine sets up a 3-D "super block" model and orders the data
c by super block number.  The limits of the super block is set to the
c minimum and maximum limits of the grid; data outside are assigned to
c the nearest edge block.
c
c The idea is to establish a 3-D block network that contains all the
c relevant data.  The data are then sorted by their index location in
c the search network, i.e., the index location is given after knowing
c the block index in each coordinate direction (ix,iy,iz):
c          ii = (iz-1)*nxsup*nysup + (iy-1)*nxsup + ix
c An array, the same size as the number of super blocks, is constructed
c that contains the cumulative number of data in the model.  With this
c array it is easy to quickly check what data are located near any given
c location.

c INPUT VARIABLES:
c
c   nx,xmn,xsiz      Definition of the X grid being considered
c   ny,ymn,ysiz      Definition of the Y grid being considered

      integer nisb(*)
      logical inflag
c
c Establish the number and size of the super blocks:
c
      nxsup   = min(nx,MAXSBX)
      nysup   = min(ny,MAXSBY)
      nzsup   = min(nz,MAXSBZ)
      xsizsup = real(nx)*xsiz/real(nxsup)
      ysizsup = real(ny)*ysiz/real(nysup)
      zsizsup = real(nz)*zsiz/real(nzsup)
      xmnsup  = (xmn-0.5*xsiz)+0.5*xsizsup
      ymnsup  = (ymn-0.5*ysiz)+0.5*ysizsup
      zmnsup  = (zmn-0.5*zsiz)+0.5*zsizsup
c
c Initialize the extra super block array to zeros:
c
      do i=1,nxsup*nysup*nzsup
            nisb(i) = 0
      end do
c
c Loop over all the data assigning the data to a super block and
c accumulating how many data are in each super block:
c
      do i=1,nd
            call getindx(nxsup,xmnsup,xsizsup,x(i),ix,inflag)
            call getindx(nysup,ymnsup,ysizsup,y(i),iy,inflag)
            call getindx(nzsup,zmnsup,zsizsup,z(i),iz,inflag)
            ii = ix + (iy-1)*nxsup + (iz-1)*nxsup*nysup
            tmp(i)   = ii
            nisb(ii) = nisb(ii) + 1
      end do
c
c Sort the data by ascending super block number:
c
      nsort = 4 + nsec
      call sortem(1,nd,tmp,nsort,x,y,z,vr,sec1,sec2,sec3)
c
c Set up array nisb with the starting address of the block data:
c
      do i=1,(nxsup*nysup*nzsup-1)
            nisb(i+1) = nisb(i) + nisb(i+1)
      end do

c
      return
