c    Squared Anisotropic Distance Calculation Given Matrix Indicator
c    ***************************************************************
c
c This routine calculates the anisotropic distance between two points
c  given the coordinates of each point and a definition of the
c  anisotropy.

c   rotmat           The rotation matrices
c
c
c
c OUTPUT VARIABLES:
c
c   sqdist           The squared distance accounting for the anisotropy
c                      and the rotation of coordinates (if any).
