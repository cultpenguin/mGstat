c
c Fortran implementation of ACORN random number generator of order less
c than or equal to 12 (higher orders can be obtained by increasing the
c parameter value MAXORD).
c
c
c NOTES: 1. The variable idum is a dummy variable. The common block
c           IACO is used to transfer data into the function.
c
c        2. Before the first call to ACORN the common block IACO must
c           be initialised by the user, as follows. The values of
c           variables in the common block must not subsequently be
c           changed by the user.
c
c             KORDEI - order of generator required ( must be =< MAXORD)
c
c             MAXINT - modulus for generator, must be chosen small
c                      enough that 2*MAXINT does not overflow
c
c             ixv(1) - seed for random number generator
c                      require 0 < ixv(1) < MAXINT
c
c             (ixv(I+1),I=1,KORDEI)
c                    - KORDEI initial values for generator
c                      require 0 =< ixv(I+1) < MAXINT
c
c        3. After initialisation, each call to ACORN generates a single
c           random number between 0 and 1.
c
c        4. An example of suitable values for parameters is
c
c             KORDEI   = 10
c             MAXINT   = 2**30
c             ixv(1)   = an odd integer in the (approximate) range 
c                        (0.001 * MAXINT) to (0.999 * MAXINT)
c             ixv(I+1) = 0, I=1,KORDEI
