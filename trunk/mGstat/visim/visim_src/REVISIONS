VERSION 1.6, Jan, 2010 :
DSSIM simulation of highly skewed target histograms improved

VERSION 1.7, Jan, 2010 : 
Fixed problem opening files using Gfortran

VERSION 1.8, Feb, 2010:
Added option to use mask files, to simulate/estimate only part of the model parameter space.
If the 'visim.par' is used as a parameter file, mask simulation is performed if the files 'visim_mask.out' exist. 
visim_mask.out must be a one column EAS file with as many data values as number for data (NXYZ). A '1' indicated that the correpsonding data location should be computed, '0' means that it will be omitted.
Check out visim_mask.m from mGstat fo handling of mask from Matlab.
