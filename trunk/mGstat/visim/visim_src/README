* ONE CANNOT USIE MORE THAN 399 FILES !!!!
* REALTED TO datacov

Edit the parameter 'COMP' in the two files :

visim/gslib/Makefile 
visim/Makefile

to point to your fortran compiler of choice. 

GFortran and Intel Fortran is known to work nicely.
Gfortran for winXP can be downloaded from :
http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?call=fortran


To compile :
cd gslib
make
cd ..
make

This should create the visim binary in visim/visim

in visim_examples contains examples of running visim.

If you use Matlab consider downloading mGstat http://mgstat.sourceforge.net/ that contains an interface to run visim, edit the parameter files, and plot simulations resilts.


___________

If you experience strange behaviour please check that the parameters in 
visim.inc, is properly selected prior to compiling.
Specifically check that 
*) the dimension is OK (MAXX,MAXY,MAXZ)
*) the volume neighborhood is large enough (MAXVOLS,MAXDINVOL)
*) The number used for nonsampled data point is approrpiately low (UNEST) 

A number of different include files is included as an example

Some of the figures in the manuscript have been generated based on the examples given in the sub directory visim_examples.

If you intend to use VISIM for corss borehole tomograophy, the you should download http://mgstat.sf.net/, as it contains an interface to VISIM, as well as the tools for linear and linearized inversion (using high and/or finite frequency sensitivity kernels)
