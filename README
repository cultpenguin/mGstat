Please read the manual for mGstat available at 
http://mgstat.sourceforge.net/

An ultra short intro guide for mGstat :
Open Matlab and change directory to the folder in which you unpacked mGstat*.zip of mGstat*.tgz:
run the following command in matlab:
mgstat_set_path

This sets the proper paths and saves the path for future Matlab session. 

Then, go to a working directory, and try out some of the demos:
